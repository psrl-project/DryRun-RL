"""The request data model shared across the simulator.

A `Request` is the unit of work every component handles: the workload generator
creates it, the router places it, `NativeInstance` generates its tokens, the
staleness policy decides when it is consumed, and the trainer batches it. Its
`Segment` list records which weight version produced each stretch of tokens,
which is what the staleness metrics are computed from.
